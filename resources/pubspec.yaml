# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  assets:
    - assets/pngs/
    - assets/svgs/
  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Comfortaa
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Comfortaa-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Comfortaa-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Comfortaa-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Comfortaa-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: WorkSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
